<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This zip file contains the source code for the seond edition of &quot;Moving to
VB.NET: Strategies, Concepts and Code&quot;.</p>
<p>This file contains two separate source trees, one for Visual Studio 2002 and
one for Visual Studio 2003. The sample code for both is virtually identical (as
the changes between language versions were quite minor).</p>
<h2>To Extract the Files:</h2>
<p>Use any zip program - be sure to specify that you wish to preserve the
directory structure when you unzip the files.</p>
<p>The sample code for chapter 14 includes a number of web applications and web
services. These are most easily installed using the .msi installation files as
described in the chapter 14 text.</p>
<h2>File Organization</h2>
<p>The sample code for each section can be found in the SourceVS02\ch# or
SourceVS03\ch# subdirectories, where # is the number of the chapter.</p>
<p>To conserve space, only source files are provided. You must build the sample
programs on your own by loading the solution files into Visual Studio and
building the applications.</p>
<p>Some directories contain readme.txt files that contain additional information
regarding building that particular example.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>This sample code release is dated April 2003. There are no current changes.</p>
<p>Changes and corrections to the first edition of the book are available on
Desaware's web site. There is no change list from the first edition to the
second (differences between the first and second edition are due to new content
and VS2003 updates, not errors in the first edition)..&nbsp;</p>
